-- We attempted to collect 5 hour data but due to a disconnection after 3.5 hours, we were unable to do so and could not figure out the logistics to retake the data. 
-- The 3.5 hour data is divided into 7 30-minute bags and concatenated for analysis later on. This was done to get overall sufficient data.
